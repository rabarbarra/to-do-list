### To Do List 

You know what they say - each time a junior writes a to do list, a small puppy dies.
Nevertheless, building this app has taught me a lot of fundamental concepts, including how to write simple class-based views.

To create this app, I followed a tutorial from Dennis Ivy.

The app includes:
- user registration and login,
- user authentication,
- viewing, adding, editing and deleting tasks.
- a search bar.
